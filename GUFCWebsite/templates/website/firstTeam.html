                If anything it was just a surprise City did not add even more sheen to the margin of victory bearing in
                mind there was never a single part of the match when they looked bored by their own brilliance. City, to
                put it into context, have now scored twice or more in every Premier League home match this season, a
                feat no top-division team has managed in 15 successive games since Tottenham Hotspur from March to
                December 1965, with Bill Nicholson in the dugout and Jimmy Greaves terrorising opposition defences.
                Including the cup competitions the reigning champions have accumulated 33 goals from their last six home
                games. It feels like a statistic from another time, a sepia-tinted era of baggy shorts and boggy
                pitches.

                For Agüero it was his 15th hat-trick in City’s colours and perhaps it would be impertinent to dwell too
                long on the moment, at 1-0, when he also produced possibly the worst miss of all his years in English
                football. Two yards out, Agüero might argue one would have to go back in time even further to find
                similar. No matter: his first goal came five minutes later and perhaps there was a measure of anger
                contained in his firecracker of a shot, 25 yards out, into the top corner of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s net.
                Missing a sitter, scoring a screamer – who cares if it was unorthodox when Agüero has 25 goals in his
                last 16 starts for City at this ground?
